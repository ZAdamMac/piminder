# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the current major version (1.0) and a limited number of feature releases will be supported.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the risk is a service compromise, such as:
- Arbitrary Code Execution or;
- A container escape.

Please contact securty@kenshosec.com rather than opening a ticket, due to the potentially sensitive nature of such information.

For all other security issues (privesc, etc), a typical issue ticket would suffice.

Please follow this repo for security updates. Pyminder does not report its usage back to base and we do not have a registration program, so we have no way to reach out to you if vulnerabilities are found.
