# Welcome to the PyminderContributor Guidelines!
Hey, thanks for checking us out!

First off, let me just say that any contribution matters - from pull-requesting in new functions, to requesting new features, or even just reporting your crashes and bugs. Clearly, there's potentially a lot of work to be done here if this becomes and ongoing-development project.
 
Pyminder doesn't have automated crash and bug reporting, and its unlikely it ever will. I'm just one guy with a few spare hours in the evening trying to put this thing together. Everything you contribute helps.

Secondly, we do have a few resources for the eager:
- [**Discord Server:**](https://discord.gg/34KJfkg) easily the fastest way to join in the conversation or ask a question;
- [Email Development Team](mailto:pymdev@kenshosec.com);
- and, of course, this guide!

# Development Team
While everyone who contributes to the project is part of our development team, the capital-letters Development Team currently consists of github user ZAdamMac.

You don't need to join the Development Team to submit issues or PRs, but if you want to get your hands dirty as a more deeply-involved voice in the future of this project, drop me a line.

# Feature Requests
We're always happy to have a look at requests for new features. They further our quest for maximum utility and usability.

## Filing a Feature Request
If you have a feature request for Tapestry, go ahead and open a new issue at this repo. Be sure to head the title of the request with `[RFC]`. The development team will cross-post your request in announcements to the discord and any other contact trains we happen to be using at the time, opening the request up for commentary by other members. **Roughly 30 days later**, the same group will decide whether or not to include the feature, or some version of it, into the development process. If the feature is complicated or discussion over it is lively, this decision process may be extended as necessary to allow the matter to resolve. Likewise, if there isn't much discussion to be had, we might just jump on it right away, if deemed necessary.

# Bug Reports
We kind of can't overstate the importance of providing your bug reports to us. It's so important we've made a template for them. When Tapestry crashes on your system, we have no idea what happened or why. Please be encouraged to file an issue and fill out the bugs form. Super important stuff.

# Contributing with Code: The Pull Request!
For Pyminder, we use Fork and Request. If you want to contribute to the development process with your code, the preferred method is to first fork the repo, make your changes there, and then submit a pull request. For obvious reasons all submissions are subject to review. To make this whole process easier, be sure to use nice, clear, descriptive code. Provide documentation and comments as needed.

In general though, we're super happy to have any help that we can. People who contribute with code are being kept track of and will be included in the credits.

# Contributing with Coins
Pyminder is and ever will be free-as-in-beer software, provided at no charge and by donation to users of all scales.

As a freeware project, we're obviously working with the bare minimum funding possible - luckily, this sort of thing also doesn't take much. If you'd like to donate to keep Pyminder's development alive, a one-time donation can be made by purchasing us some ~~debugger fluid~~ coffee via Ko-Fi.com:

[![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/A8614WZ3)

As a note, this is my personal Ko-Fi - if this ever becomes the work of a full-blown development group an organizational account will be created.

If you want to support Tapestry's development on an ongoing basis, [consider backing ZAdamMac through Github Sponsors](https://github.com/users/ZAdamMac/sponsorship). This is an especially helpful case as Github is currently matching sponsors' donations in order to promote the Sponsors platform.

At present, we simply have no way for you to contribute with cryptocurrencies. If this is something you'd like to consider, let us know and we'll discuss the possibilities.
